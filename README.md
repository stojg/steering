# Steering

This is a Go implementation of classic game steering behaviours that allows autonomous characters to move around in a realistic manner. By combining different steering behaviours we can simulate things like a flock of birds flying or sheeps in a paddock. Steering behaviours were originally a concept described in a paper by Craig W. Reynolds, [Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/). Agents are only using local environment information and with that can still display a complex and realistic movements.
